This repository collects some resources for learning the basics of Constraint
Satisfaction Problems.

First, it is important to know a little bit of complexity theory.  You can pick
up the essentails (which is all we'll need) from Wikipedia.  I've collected the
most relevant entries here:

(If you want to help "edit" this "book" by adding other pages that you have read
and found particularly useful, let me know and I'll give you book
editing privileges.)

Here are some references for learning about the algebraic approach to CSP:

1. Cliff Bergman's very nice summary of the most important CSP concepts: https://orion.math.iastate.edu/jdhsmith/math/CSPGTUA.pdf

2. Miklos Maroti's slides (we've made it through about half of these so far): http://www.math.u-szeged.hu/~mmaroti/pdf/talks/2012%20Tutorial%20on%20the%20constraint%20satisfaction%20problem.pdf

3. Benoit Larose's broad overview of CSP and Algebra (slides):
http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/Events/fmt2012/SLIDES/benoitlarose.pdf

4. Ross Willard's slides from SSAOS 2014:
<a href="Slides/ssaos2014-hand1.pdf"> lecture 1</a>, 
<a href="Slides/ssaos2014-hand2.pdf"> lecture 2</a>, 
<a href="Slides/ssaos2014-hand3.pdf"> lecture 3</a>.  
(a very nice presentation with lots of details about some interesting new ideas)

5. Libor Barto's overview: http://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~barto/Articles/Barto_SigLog_Final.pdf

6. David Failing's phd thesis has lots more details: http://www.davidfailing.com/papers/thesis.pdf
